# D-D-Encounter-Builder

# Project Overview

## Project Name

D&D Encounter Builder

## Project Description

The minimum viable product will be a tool for players to reference the important stats for a given monster in D&D.
The full application will allow people running games of D&D to take those monsters that they reference, and build encounters while calculating how difficult the encounter will be for their players. There's usually a ton of complexity in this, but the calculations are actually simple, especially if they're automated.

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Find and use external api 
- Allow user to view statistics of a monster
- Break the search down from 1086 options using multiple selectors
- Render data on page 

#### PostMVP  

- Add second screen
- Add second toolbar
- Allow for comparison vs party composition\
- Render data on page
